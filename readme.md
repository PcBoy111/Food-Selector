# Food selector

Food Selector allows the user to input their wanted dishes, and selects one of them at random.
The user must add at least two dishes for the program to finish.

To complete inputting dishes:
    enter nothing
    enter a semicolon (;)
    add a semicolon to the end of a dish (will still input the dish)

To exit this program, enter a period (.)
